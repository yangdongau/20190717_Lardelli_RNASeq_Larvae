This website contains the analysis of RNAseq data from an experiment comparing zebrafish larvae from two genotypes.
One genotype represented wild-type larvae, whilst the other genotype was a heterozygous mutation for the gene *psen1*, in which 6 nucleotides were deleted, to remove the two amino acids Q96 and K97.
This mutation is generally referred to as *psen1^Q96K97^*.
